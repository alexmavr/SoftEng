\section{Overview}
    In place of the default Software Engineering Cource project we present this
    project proposal. The proposed project is a meta-search engine used to monitor
    sites for required information provide notifications to it's users accordingly. 

\section{High-Level Description}
\section{Components}
    The project consists of the following three main components.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A web application framework providing the interface and the
            connection?? to the database.
        \item A distributed data collection system (crawler network).
        \item A notification system.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Framework}
        The framework allows the developer produce a configuration of the web
        application in order to provide the interface to the end user and the
        sites as well as the methods of the searching process.
    \subsection{Data Collection System}
        The data collection system is a distributed network of crawlers which poll
        the server on predefined intervals in order to get a workload. They
        process the workload searching on the sites they were assigned to and send
        the results back to the server.
    \subsection{Notification System}
        The notification system depends on email services. When a notification is
        triggered, the notification system is to send an email to the end user
        with the information he requested.
\section{Interactions}
    \subsection{Generic Use Cases}
        \subsubsection{Developer Case}
            None yet. Feel free to add some.
        \subsubsection{End User Case}
            The End User interacts with the web application and the notification
            system. He specifies the search terms on the web user interface configured
            appropriately by the developer. The framework handles the user request and
            forwards the necessary information to the crawler network.

    \subsection{End User Scenarios}
        None yet. Feel free to add some.

\section{Specifications}
    None yet. Feel free to add some.
