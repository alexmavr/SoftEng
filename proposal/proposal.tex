\section{Overview}
    In place of the default Software Engineering Cource project we present this
    project proposal. The proposed project is a meta-search engine used to monitor
    websites according to its users requests and notify them appropriately. 

\section{High-Level Description}
    None yet. Feel free to add some.
\section{Components}
    The project consists of the following three main components.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A web application framework providing the interface and the
            connection?? to the database.
        \item A distributed data collection system (crawler network).
        \item A notification system.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Framework}
        The framework allows the developer to produce a configuration of the web
        application in order to provide an interface to the end user, declare the
        desired sites to be monitored and define the methods of the searching process.
    \subsection{Data Collection System}
        The data collection system is a distributed network of crawlers which poll
        the server on predefined intervals in order to receive a workload. They then
        proceed to process the workload by searching on the sites for the required data 
        and send the results back to the server.
    \subsection{Notification System}
        The notification system provides email services. When a notification is
        triggered, the notification system is to send an email to the end user
        with the information he requested.
\section{Interactions}
    \subsection{Generic Use Cases}
        \subsubsection{Developer Case}
            The developer configures the framework to provide a front-end to the end user
            and a collection of websites which will be crawled for the requested data.
            For each website, he will need to provide the corresponding instructions
            so the crawlers will be able to locate the data of interest.
            Additionally, He has full control over which subsets of the website collection
            will be available to the end user.
        \subsubsection{End User Case}
            The end user interacts with the web application and the notification
            system. He specifies the search terms on the web user interface and selects
            the sites to be monitored, as configured appropriately by the developer. 
            The framework then handles the user request and forwards the necessary 
            information to the crawler network. When an appropriate result is found, 
            the user is notified by the notification system.

    \subsection{End User Scenarios}
        None yet. Feel free to add some.
